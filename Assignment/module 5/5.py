In Django, a QuerySet is a collection of data from a database. A QuerySet is built up as a list of objects. QuerySets make it easier to get the data you actually need by allowing you to filter and order the data at an early stage. 


from myapp.models import Post

post = Post(title='My Title', content='My Content')
post.save()
